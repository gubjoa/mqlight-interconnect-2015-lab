# Developing a first application with IBM MQ Light

This repository contains a set of samples demonstrating how to use the MQ Light
Service for Bluemix to write cloud apps which can perform worker offload. It
was used to run a lab session at IBM InterConnect 2015

Check out the
[IBM MQ Light Homepage](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-light/) or the 
[Bluemix documentation](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/MQLight/) for
more info on these and other samples.

## What you will learn

This lab will teach you how you can improve the responsiveness and scalability
of your web applications, both on premise and in the cloud using MQ Light and
MQ Light Service in IBM Bluemix.

It will explain how to off-load heavy workloads to separate worker threads
while your web handlers deal quickly and efficiently with the requests from
your online users.

As software developers we want our applications to be responsive and scalable
to really engage users, but it's not always easy to write code that behaves
like this. MQ Light and the MQ Light Service in IBM Bluemix are great tools
that helps applications off-load work to be dealt with asynchronously thus
ensuring your applications responds quickly. Additionally, as workload
increases, applications that use MQ Light become very easy to scale up.

You will also learn how to use the MQ Light user interface to understand and
debug the messages that your application has sent and received.
